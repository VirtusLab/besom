This release is also the first release marking our march towards the stability of the APIs crafted with awesome developer experience in mind. Before getting into new features and changes let\'s step back a bit and discuss what Besom really is and why we\'ve built it.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n### A wider perspective\\n\\nCurrent landscape of software engineering is different in comparison to what it was just a decade ago when Terraform launched but even then the trend towards programmatic management of not only business problems but also software and hardware operations was clearly visible. The space itself was dominated by fragile bash scripting and configuration management DSLs that required additional learning and provided little elasticity. The complexity of software itself grew however as Internet grew ever bigger. It is therefore our opinion that software engineering will evolve to incorporate platform engineering as a first-class citizen - not as a thing that a remote operations teams does but as a natural part of application lifecycle that every developer can easily work with. This merge is already happening with new emergent technologies like [Klotho](https://klo.dev) and [Nitric](https://nitric.io/) but what is first necessary for proliferation of this approach is the common fundamental abstraction of platform resources. \\n\\nWe believe that [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) is the solution for Infrastructure as Software (IaS) - a tool like Terraform but much more elastic, much more accessible, composable and developer-friendly. Pulumi can be used from any language that offers a SDK and that\'s how it marries the ops with the dev - you use the tool that you use to declare resources your application will use and execute on. In the same vein of modern requirements in IT - scalability, robustness, reliability and performance - Scala is a proven contender that keeps evolving to meet new demands. We\'ve felt that the next frontier the scalable language can manage is the domain of platform engineering. For this reason we have joined our forces with Pulumi to first bring Pulumi to JVM with the [Java SDK](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-java) and then, based on that experience, built [Besom, the Scala SDK for Pulumi](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom). Besom is therefore a way to declare and manage infrastructural resources in an idiomatic, functional way using Scala.\\n\\nI am, personally, of the opinion that code is worth a million words so the best way to show you how easy reliable[^1] cloud engineering becomes with Besom is to just write some code! Quite often what you want to do is to just run your small app somewhere. Let\'s assume, for the sake of example, that \\"somewhere\\" is the Google Cloud Platform\'s Cloud Run service which is a managed runtime for containerised applications. \\n\\n### The App\\n\\nLet\'s start with a small web app. To keep things as simple as possible we\'ll use [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) which will take care of packaging our application for us. We\'ll also use [tapir\'s](https://tapir.softwaremill.com/en/latest/server/jdkhttp.html) JDK HTTP server support and leverage Loom because it\'s just free performance. Let\'s create a directory for the whole project somewhere and then put our app in `./app` subdirectory. The `project.scala` file will look like this: \\n\\n```scala\\n//> using scala 3.3.3\\n//> using options -Werror -Wunused:all -Wvalue-discard -Wnonunit-statement\\n\\n//> using jvm \\"graalvm-java21:21.0.2\\"\\n\\n//> using dep com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir::tapir-jdkhttp-server:1.9.10\\n//> using dep com.softwaremill.sttp.tapir::tapir-files:1.9.10\\n//> using dep com.outr::scribe:3.13.0\\n\\n//> using publish.organization org.virtuslab.besom.example\\n//> using publish.name app\\n\\n//> using resourceDir resources\\n```\\n\\nThe `scala-cli` directives are pretty self-explanatory:\\n- we use Scala 3.3.3 LTS\\n- we add some linting options for the compiler\\n- we select GraalVM CE for JDK 21 as the runtime (because of Loom and because GraalVM is awesome)\\n- we also pull some dependencies - tapir for http server along with static file serving module and scribe for logging\\n- we name the project for publishing\\n- and finally we designate a directory that will contain our resources\\n\\nThe whole app fits in a single file - two endpoints, a HTML snippet as string and a http server definition:\\n```scala\\npackage org.virtuslab.besom.example\\n\\nimport sttp.tapir.*\\nimport sttp.tapir.server.jdkhttp.*\\nimport sttp.tapir.files.*\\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors\\nimport sttp.model.HeaderNames\\n\\n@main def main(): Unit =\\n  // required by Cloud Run Container runtime contract\\n  // https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/container-contract\\n  val host = \\"0.0.0.0\\"\\n  val port = sys.env.get(\\"PORT\\").flatMap(_.toIntOption).getOrElse(8080)\\n\\n  // handle index path only\\n  val indexEndpoint = endpoint.get\\n    .in(\\"\\")\\n    .in(extractFromRequest(_.connectionInfo.remote))\\n    .in(header[Option[String]](HeaderNames.XForwardedFor))\\n    .out(htmlBodyUtf8)\\n    .handle { case (requestHost, xff) =>\\n      val remote = xff.orElse(requestHost).getOrElse(\\"unknown\\")\\n      val forwarded = if xff.isDefined then \\"forwarded\\" else \\"not forwarded\\"\\n\\n      scribe.info(s\\"Received request from $remote ($forwarded) serving index.html...\\")\\n\\n      Right(index)\\n    }\\n\\n  // serve resources in \\"static\\" directory under static/ path\\n  val staticResourcesEndpoint =\\n    staticResourcesGetServerEndpoint[Id](\\"static\\")(\\n      // use classloader used to load this application\\n      classOf[this.type].getClassLoader,\\n      \\"static\\"\\n    )\\n\\n  scribe.info(s\\"Starting server on $host:$port\\")\\n  val _ = JdkHttpServer()\\n    // use Loom\'s virtual threads to dispatch requests\\n    .executor(Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor())\\n    .host(host)\\n    .port(port)\\n    .addEndpoint(staticResourcesEndpoint)\\n    .addEndpoint(indexEndpoint)\\n    .start()\\n\\n// html template using tailwind css\\nval index: String =\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n  <!DOCTYPE html>\\n  <html lang=\\"en\\">\\n  <head>\\n    <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\">\\n    <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\">\\n    <link href=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css\\" rel=\\"stylesheet\\">\\n    <title>Scala 3 app!</title>\\n  </head>\\n  <body>\\n    <div class=\\"flex h-screen w-full justify-center items-center\\">\\n      <img src=\\"static/scala.png\\" alt=\\"scala logo\\"/>\\n    </div>\\n  </body>\\n  </html>\\n  \\"\\"\\"\\n```\\n\\nIt doesn\'t do much as you can see as it only solves the hardest problem in web development using tailwind and displays Scala logo centered horizontally and vertically. \\n\\nWe can check if tailwind did a good job by simply executing one command in the directory storing both files and navigating to `localhost:8080` in browser.\\n\\n```bash\\nscala-cli run app\\n```\\n\\nIf you don\'t have `scala-cli` on your machine already it is super [easy to fix](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/), e.g.:\\n```bash\\ncurl -sSLf https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/get | sh\\n```\\n\\n### Run App, Run!\\n\\nWe have our app and now we need to deploy it \\"somewhere\\" using Besom. To [get started](https://virtuslab.github.io/besom/docs/getting_started) we need to install Pulumi:\\n```bash\\ncurl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com/ | sh\\n```\\n\\nand then install Scala language plugin for Pulumi:\\n\\n```bash\\npulumi plugin install language scala 0.2.2 --server github://api.github.com/VirtusLab/besom\\n```\\n\\nHaving done that we can initialise a new project:\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir infra && cd infra\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\npulumi new https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/tree/v0.2.2/templates/gcp\\n```\\n\\nThis will launch project builder, ask us some basic questions about how the project will be called, how the initial stack will be called and also what password should be used to encrypt the secrets[^2]. We end up with 4 files inside of `./infra` directory:\\n\\n* `Main.scala` which contains our infrastructure as Scala code\\n* `project.scala` which contains `scala-cli` directives\\n* `Pulumi.yaml` which contains public settings of the project\\n* `Pulumi.$STACK.yaml` which contains the secrets bound to particular stack where `$STACK` is the name we have provided in the previous step \\n\\nTo start we will need to add docker support for besom so that we can push our application\'s image to Google Container Registry (GCR). To do that we need to put these lines into `project.scala`:\\n\\n```scala\\n//> using dep \\"org.virtuslab::besom-docker:4.5.1-core.0.2\\"\\n```\\n\\nSince we want Besom to manage our image building we won\'t be able to benefit from `scala-cli`\'s built-in Docker packaging capabilities but that\'s actually fine because we would like our Cloud Run app to have the smallest possible footprint possible. To do that we will need to leverage another application packaging capability of `scala-cli` - that of GraalVM native-image building. Besom\'s Docker integration expects us to provide a `Dockerfile` that will describe how to create the image and that\'s exactly what we\'re going to do by putting this content into `./app/Dockerfile`: \\n\\n```Dockerfile\\nFROM --platform=linux/amd64 debian:stable-slim AS build-env\\n\\nARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\\nRUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \\\\\\n    apt-get update  \\\\\\n    && apt-get install -y curl gzip build-essential libz-dev zlib1g-dev\\n\\n# Install Scala CLI\\nARG SCALA_CLI_VERSION=1.1.2\\nRUN \\\\\\n    curl -sSLf https://github.com/VirtusLab/scala-cli/releases/download/v${SCALA_CLI_VERSION}/scala-cli-x86_64-pc-linux.gz | gunzip -c > /usr/local/bin/scala-cli  \\\\\\n    && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/scala-cli  \\\\\\n    && /usr/local/bin/scala-cli version\\n\\nFROM --platform=linux/amd64 build-env AS build\\nWORKDIR /src\\n# Copy local code to the container image\\nCOPY . .\\n# Build a native binary with Scala CLI\\nARG GRAALVM_VERSION=21.0.2\\nRUN \\\\\\n    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/coursier \\\\\\n    /usr/local/bin/scala-cli --power package . \\\\\\n    --suppress-experimental-feature-warning \\\\\\n    --server=false \\\\\\n    --jvm=graalvm-java21:${GRAALVM_VERSION} \\\\\\n    --native-image \\\\\\n    --graalvm-jvm-id=graalvm-java21:${GRAALVM_VERSION} \\\\\\n    --graalvm-args=\\"--static\\" \\\\\\n    --graalvm-args=\\"--install-exit-handlers\\" \\\\\\n    --graalvm-args=\\"--no-fallback\\" \\\\\\n    --graalvm-args=\\"-H:IncludeResources=.*png\\" \\\\\\n    --main-class org.virtuslab.besom.example.main -o app -f\\n\\nFROM --platform=linux/amd64 gcr.io/distroless/static\\n# Copy the binary to the production image from the builder stage\\nCOPY --from=build /src/app /bin/app\\n\\n# Run the web service on container startup.\\nCMD [\\"/bin/app\\"]\\n```\\n\\nThis multi-stage `Dockerfile` will yield a very small final (34.4 MB!) image that will contain only the binary of our app. It also takes care of cross-compilation if necessary.\\n\\nWith this set up we can finally write down infrastructure necessary to deploy our service. Let\'s clear out our main function\'s body and start with some basic definitions:\\n\\n```scala\\n@main def main = Pulumi.run {\\n  val project = config.requireString(\\"gcp:project\\")\\n  val region  = config.requireString(\\"gcp:region\\")\\n  \\n  val repoName      = p\\"gcr.io/${project}/${pulumiProject}\\" // will be automatically created by GCP on docker push\\n  val appName       = \\"app\\"\\n  val imageFullName = p\\"${repoName}/${appName}:latest\\"\\n  \\n  Stack.exports(\\n    dockerImage = imageFullName\\n  )\\n```\\n\\nFirst we declare that our program needs some values from configuration regarding the GCP project ID and the region to which we want to deploy to. Configuration will be returned as `Output[String]` values which are roughly equal to `IO[String]` (or `Task[String]` if you prefer ZIO)  but we need to interpolate that information to build the image name for GCR. Usually that would involve writing something akin to:\\n\\n```scala\\nval imageFullName = project.map { proj =>\\n  val repoName = s\\"gcr.io/${proj}/${pulumiProject}\\"\\n  val appName = \\"app\\"\\n  s\\"${repoName}/${appName}:latest\\"\\n}    \\n```\\n\\nbut Besom offers a `p\\"\\"` / `pulumi\\"\\"` string interpolator that simplifies this a lot and returns `Output[String]` for us.\\n\\nGoogle Cloud Platform requires us to enable services that we wish to use and therefore the first Besom resource that we have to create will be `gcp.projects.Service` that allows us to manage service configuration for the project. We will future-proof it a bit with a small enum and make a small, helpful wrapper for the capabilities that we need:\\n\\n```scala\\n  enum GoogleApis(val name: String):\\n    case CloudRun extends GoogleApis(\\"run.googleapis.com\\")\\n    def enableApiKey: NonEmptyString = s\\"enable-${name.replace(\\".\\", \\"-\\")}\\"\\n\\n  // Enable GCP service(s) for the current project\\n  val enableServices: Map[GoogleApis, Output[gcp.projects.Service]] = List(\\n    GoogleApis.CloudRun\\n  ).map(api =>\\n    api -> gcp.projects.Service(\\n      api.enableApiKey,\\n      gcp.projects.ServiceArgs(\\n        project = project,\\n        service = api.name,\\n        /* if true - at every destroy this will disable the dependent services for the whole project */\\n        disableDependentServices = true,\\n        /* if true - at every destroy this will disable the service for the whole project */\\n        disableOnDestroy = true\\n      )\\n    )\\n  ).toMap\\n```\\n\\nFor these services to be configured (there\'s just one for now) we have to make the Stack aware of the necessity their evaluation. We modify the result of our main function then:\\n\\n```scala\\nStack(\\n  Output.sequence(enableServices.values)\\n).exports(\\n  dockerImage = imageFullName\\n)\\n```\\n\\nWith this change we can run our Besom project using `pulumi up` in `./infra` directory and Pulumi will be able to enable Cloud Run service for us.\\n\\nNext step is for Besom to build and push our Docker image for us. This bit is quite straightforwards - we only need to introduce a new import on the top of the file:\\n\\n```scala\\nimport besom.api.docker\\n```\\n\\nand then declare a `docker.Image` resource like this:\\n\\n```scala\\n  // Build a Docker image from our Scala app and push it to GCR\\n  val image = docker.Image(\\n    \\"image\\",\\n    docker.ImageArgs(\\n      imageName = imageFullName,\\n      build = docker.inputs.DockerBuildArgs(\\n        context = p\\"../${appName}\\",\\n        platform = \\"linux/amd64\\" // Cloud Run only supports linux/amd64\\n      )\\n    )\\n  )\\n```\\n\\nWe provide a full name of the image that we\'ve constructed before, the path to Docker context - our `Dockerfile` in `./app` folder and the platform for which we want the image to be built for. \\n\\nNext step is to deploy a Cloud Run service:\\n```scala\\n  val service = gcp.cloudrun.Service(\\n    \\"service\\",\\n    gcp.cloudrun.ServiceArgs(\\n      location = region,\\n      name = appName,\\n      template = gcp.cloudrun.inputs.ServiceTemplateArgs(\\n        spec = gcp.cloudrun.inputs.ServiceTemplateSpecArgs(\\n          containers = gcp.cloudrun.inputs.ServiceTemplateSpecContainerArgs(\\n            image = image.imageName,\\n            resources = gcp.cloudrun.inputs.ServiceTemplateSpecContainerResourcesArgs(\\n              limits = Map(\\n                \\"memory\\" -> \\"1Gi\\"\\n              )\\n            )\\n          ) :: Nil\\n        )\\n      )\\n    ),\\n    opts(dependsOn = enableServices(GoogleApis.CloudRun))\\n  )\\n```\\n\\nThis is a bit more involved as there are more properties to configure:\\n* we pass information about the region in which this deployment should happen in\\n* we set up the name of the Cloud Run service - `app`\\n* we then specify that we want to use our container with 1 GB of RAM\\n\\nOne important thing here is that we pass a resource option declaring that this resource has to be created only after Cloud Run service is enabled. Pulumi is parallel by default not to choke on relatively slow cloud provider APIs and therefore some sequential relationships between resources require a manual setup of the dependency in the evaluation graph. This is not necessary when an output value of one resource is used as an input for another but in this case we have to give Pulumi a small hint.\\n\\nFinally, we have to inform GCP that we want anyone to be able to reach our application from the internet by configuring an IAM member resource:\\n\\n```scala\\n  // Open the service to public unrestricted access\\n  val serviceIam = gcp.cloudrun.IamMember(\\n    \\"service-iam-everyone\\",\\n    gcp.cloudrun.IamMemberArgs(\\n      location = service.location,\\n      service = service.name,\\n      role = \\"roles/run.invoker\\",\\n      member = \\"allUsers\\"\\n    )\\n  )\\n```\\n\\nThe last thing to do is to add the URL of our app to Stack\'s exports and add the IAM member to dependencies of our Stack:\\n\\n```scala\\nStack(\\n  Output.sequence(enableServices.values),\\n  serviceIam\\n).exports(\\n  dockerImage = imageFullName,\\n  // Export the DNS name of the service\\n  serviceUrl = service.statuses.map(_.headOption.map(_.url)) \\n)\\n```\\n\\nAfter this step we can run:\\n\\n```bash\\npulumi up\\n```\\n\\nin our `./infra` directory and let Pulumi handle all the heavy lifting.

While waiting anxiously to see what you build with Besom we\'ll keep ourselves busy improving the developer experience even further and delivering the [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/automation/). \\n\\n\\n[^1]: I know you can just set things up in the console of your cloud provider but common experience proves that this approach works for about a week or month and then the decay sets in and after a while someone deletes prod by accident\\n\\n[^2]: **important**, always provide a good password here, it\'s used to encrypt secrets so that you can store them in your git repo"}]}')}}]);
