Pulumi runtime is asynchronous by design. The goal is to allow the user's program to declare all the necessary resources as fast as possible so that Pulumi engine can make informed decisions about which parts of the deployment plan can be executed in parallel and therefore yield good performance. Each of the Pulumi SDKs reflects this reality by leveraging the language's asynchronous datatype to implement the internals of the SDK that communicate with Pulumi engine via gRPC. For Python it's `asyncio`, for JavaScript and TypeScript it's `Promise`, for C# it's `Task` and for Java it's `CompletableFuture`. 

Scala is a bit different in this regard. Due to extraordinary amount of innovation happening in the community and the overall focus on concurrency and asynchronicity Scala now has 3 main asynchronous, concurrent datatypes - standard library's `Future`, which is used heavily in Akka / Pekko ecosystems, cats-effect `IO` used extensively by the cats ecosystem and `ZIO` that also has it's own ecosystem. Two of these datatypes are lazy. 

To support and integrate them with Besom a decision was made to encode the SDK using the same lazy and pure semantics of execution that leverage the preferred datatype of the user. While this architectural choice has little impact on what can be done currently in standalone Pulumi programs, in the future we are going to support Pulumi's Automation API which allows users to directly embed Besom into their applications. It is at that point when direct integration with all 3 technological stacks will be the most meaningful.

Besom stands alone in this choice and due to it has some differences in comparison to how other Pulumi SDKs operate. Following 
sections explain and showcase said differences.
