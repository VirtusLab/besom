Some Pulumi features are not yet implemented. The most notable ones are:
* [Resource aliases](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/options/aliases/) are not yet available (targeted for `0.3.0` release).
* [Automation API](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/automation-api/) is not yet available (targeted for `0.3.0` release).
* [Resource transformations](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/options/transformations/) are not yet available (targeted for `0.3.0` release).
* [State Inputs](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues/285) are not yet available (todo).
* [Dynamic Providers](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/resources/dynamic-providers/) are not yet available (researching).
* [Function serialization](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/inputs-outputs/function-serialization/) is supported only in Node.js (researching).

Some Pulumi features are **NOT** planned to be implemented:
* [Mock-based unit tests](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/guides/testing/) not planned unless we hear strong community feedback it is needed.
