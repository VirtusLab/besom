title: Interpolator
---

One of the very common use case in Pulumi programs is the need to interpolate a syntax. Given that the most interesting values arrive asynchronously as Outputs of resources that user creates this usually interpolation would require a `map` call or even a `flatMap` + `map` chain for more than one Output (or a for comprehension, alternatively). To make this common pattern easier Besom implements a type-safe interpolator that works with Outputs seamlessly:
```scala
val o1: Output[Int] = pod.port
val o2: Output[String] = node.hostname
val version: String = "v1"
â€‹
// or just p"" for shorthand
val result: Output[String] = pulumi"http://$o2:$o1/api/$version/" 
```
