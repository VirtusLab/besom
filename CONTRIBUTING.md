### Feature Work

For larger features, we'd appreciate it if you open a
[new issue](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues/new)
before investing a lot of time, so we can discuss the feature together.

Please also be sure to browse
[current issues](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues)
to make sure your issue is unique, to lighten the triage burden on our maintainers.

## Branching and versioning strategy

We mostly follow the Pulumi strategy:
- `main` branch contains current `*-SNAPSHOT` version
- `vX.Y.Z` tag marks the `X.Y.Z` release
- `release/vX.Y.Z` branch contains the `X.Y.Z` release
- PRs must have a prefix with the **name of the author and issue number** e.g. `pprazak/123-fix-bug`

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure to **tag first** before creating a release branch. 

Versioning is done using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), with following additions:
- `x.y.z` for core version, where:
  - `x` no guarantees are made about compatibility,
  - `y` should not break source compatibility, 
  - `z` should not break binary compatibility
- `a.b.c-core.x.y` for provider version, where `a.b.c` is the schema version
- `*-SNAPSHOT` versions are used for development versions

## Developing

### Setting up your development environment

You will want to install the following on your machine:

- [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/) 3.30.0 or higher
- [Scala-CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/) 1.0.4 or higher

brew install coursier/formulas/coursier
brew install just
brew install java11
brew install sbt
brew install go
brew install git
brew install unzip
brew install protobuf # protoc
```

### Preparing a pull request

1. Ensure running `just` passes with no issues.
2. Ensure the branch name is prefixed with your name and contains issue number, e.g. `johndoe/123-fix-bug`.

### Understanding the repo structure

- [`core`](core) contains the core of Scala SDK for Pulumi
- [`besom-cats`](besom-cats) contains the cats effect integration for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- [`besom-zio`](besom-zio) contains the ZIO integration for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- [`codegen`](codegen) contains Scala code generation fo Besom (e.g. used for provider SDKs)
- [`proto`](proto) contains a copy of Pulumi protobuf definitions (generated by a script)
- [`compiler-plugin`](compiler-plugin) contains the compiler plugin for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- [`language-plugin`](language-plugin) contains the Golang language host provider plugin for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- [`templates`](templates) define starter project templates
- [`examples`](examples) contains examples of using Besom
- [`scripts`](scripts) contains various scripts used for development

### Working with local dependencies

There are Just targets that help rebuild all Scala and Go packages from
source. For correct cross-referencing in examples and tests, Scala
packages need to be installed into the local `~/.ivy` repo.

The targets do not yet understand dependencies accurately, so you may
need to re-run to make sure changes to Besom SDK or providers are
rebuilt.

As for Go changes, Pulumi CLI will respect the version of
`pulumi-language-scala` it finds in `PATH` over the default version it
ships with. When testing changes to the language provider, you
therefore might need to manipulate `PATH` to prefer the local version.

#### Publish necessary packages

Publish locally and install necessary Besom packages:
```bash
just publish-local-core
just publish-local-compiler-plugin
just install-language-plugin
```

#### Publish additional SDKs

You have to generate an SDK for a provider of your choice, to do that run:
```bash
just generate-provider-sdk ${provider_name} ${provider_version}
just publish-local-provider-sdk ${provider_name} ${provider_version}
```

e.g.:

```bash
just generate-provider-sdk kubernetes 4.2.0
just publish-local-provider-sdk kubernetes 4.2.0
```

### Working with published dependencies

Release builds of the Besom SDK are published to Maven Central 
as `org.virtuslab::besom-core:x.x.x`.

### Adding examples and testing them locally

Every example is a valid Pulumi program that can be tested by manually
doing `pulumi up` in the right folder.

```bash
cd exmaples/<example-name>
pulumi up
```

Here is a Just helper to run the automated testing:

```bash
just test-example aws-scala-webserver
```

### Testing templates locally

See `templates/README.md` on how to manually test template changes locally.

Similarly to examples, Just helper targets are provided to
automatically test templates, for example to test
`templates/default` run:

```bash
just test-template default
```

### Testing codegen locally

Codegen is tested by running:

```bash
just test-integration-codegen
```

To update test schema files from upstream:

```bash
just copy-test-schemas
```

### Testing Protobuf/gRPC codegen locally

Protobuf/gRPC codegen is tested by running:

```bash
just compile-pulumi-protobufs compile-core
```

## Setting up the code editor

Both IDEs support rely on BSP and is experimental.

### BSP setup with `scala-compose`

Build experimental `scala-compose` and place on `$PATH`:
```
git clone git@github.com:VirtusLab/scala-compose.git
cd scala-compose
cat << EOF | git apply
> diff --git a/project/publish.sc b/project/publish.sc
> index e00f81ca..619d4c99 100644
> --- a/project/publish.sc
> +++ b/project/publish.sc
> @@ -113,8 +113,9 @@ def finalPublishVersion = {
>      }
>    else
>      T {
> -      val state = VcsVersion.vcsState()
> -      computePublishVersion(state, simple = true)
> +      // val state = VcsVersion.vcsState()

>      }
>  }
>
> EOF
./mill -i show scala-compose.nativeImage
cp out/scala-compose/base-image/nativeImage.dest/scala-cli ~/bin/scala-compose
```

Use `scala-compose` in `besom` directory:
```bash
scala-compose setup-ide --conf-dir .
```

### IntelliJ setup
IntelliJ support is experimental.

1. Make sure you have the latest IntelliJ
2. Install Scala plugin and set update chanel to "Nightly Builds"
3. Use [BSP with `scala-cli`](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/cookbooks/intellij-multi-bsp) (also see [IntelliJ documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/bsp-support.html))

To make sure you have `.bsp` directories, by running:
```bash
just setup-intellij
```

Now open the project in IntelliJ. If neede and add modules manually using "Project Structure > Import Module" dialog.

Additionally, please set `scalafmt` as the formatter.

### VSCode setup

If you are using VSCode:
1. Install [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode#installation)
2. Open the project in Metals.

Make sure you have `.bsp` directory before you open the project in VSCode.

This might not be enough if your infrastructure is just a part (a module) of your existing Scala project.
For this to work you have to make your build tool aware of the infrastructure code,
for **sbt** create a corresponding module:
   ```scala
lazy val infra = project.in(file("infrastructure")).settings(
   libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-kubernetes" % "0.1.0", // or any other sdk you are using
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-core" % "0.1.0"
   ))
   ```
This just informs your IDE about the existence of the infrastructure module,
DO NOT remove dependencies from `project.scala`, because they are necessary in both places.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub might be throttling your requests

If you see an error like this:
- `git` failed to clone or checkout the repository
- `pulumi` failed to download the provider (401)
GitHub might be throttling your requests, try to authenticate:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
```

### Verbosity and debugging options

Pulumi has a few options that can help with debugging.

#### CLI command line

You can pass [debug options](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/support/troubleshooting/#verbose-logging) 
to any `pulumi` CLI command, e.g.:
```bash
pulumi up -v5 --logtostderr
```

Use the flag `--logflow` to apply the same log level to resource providers (but not a language provider).

#### `Pulumi.yaml` `runtime.options`

You can set `runtime.options` in `Pulumi.yaml` to pass options to the language host provider, e.g.:
```yaml
name: example
runtime:
  name: scala
  options:
    logtostderr: true
    v: 5
```

#### Environment variables

- `PULUMI_BESOM_LOG_LEVEL` - for setting Besom log level (default is `WARN`)
- `PULUMI_ENABLE_TRACE_LOGGING_TO_FILE` - for enabling Besom trace logging to file
- `PULUMI_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1` - for activating hidden debugging Pulumi CLI commands
- `TF_LOG=TRACE` - for debugging Terraform-based provider

#### Tracing

To collect and view [a trace](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/support/troubleshooting/#tracing):
```bash
pulumi up --tracing=file:./up.trace
PULUMI_DEBUG_COMMANDS=1 pulumi view-trace ./up.trace
```
