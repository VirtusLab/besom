# Contributing to Besom

Thank you for contributing to help make Besom better. We appreciate the help!

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Communications

We discuss features and file bugs on GitHub via
[Issues](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues).

### Issues

Feel free to pick up any existing issue that looks interesting to you
or fix a bug you stumble across while using Besom. 
No matter the size, we welcome all improvements.

### Feature Work

For larger features, we'd appreciate it if you open a
[new issue](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues/new)
before investing a lot of time, so we can discuss the feature together.

Please also be sure to browse
[current issues](https://github.com/VirtusLab/besom/issues)
to make sure your issue is unique, to lighten the triage burden on our maintainers.

## Developing

### Setting up your development environment

You will want to install the following on your machine:

- [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/install/) 3.30.0 or higher
- [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install/) 1.0.4 or higher
- JDK 11 or higher
- Scala 3.3.1 or higher
- Go 1.20 or higher
- [protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/) 24.3 or higher
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) 1.14.0 or higher
- git
- unzip

### Preparing a pull request

1. Ensure running `just` passes with no issues.
2. Ensure the branch name is prefixed with your name and contains issue number, e.g. `johndoe/123-fix-bug`.

### Understanding the repo structure

- `core` contains the core of Scala SDK for Pulumi
- `besom-cats` contains the cats effect integration for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- `besom-zio` contains the ZIO integration for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- `codegen` contains Scala code generation fo Besom (e.g. used for provider SDKs)
- `proto` contains a copy of Pulumi protobuf definitions
- `compiler-plugin` contains the compiler plugin for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- `language-plugin` contains the Golang language host provider plugin for Scala SDK for Pulumi
- `templates` define starter project templates
- `examples` contains examples of using Besom

### Working with local dependencies

There are Just targets that help rebuild all Scala and Go packages from
source. For correct cross-referencing in examples and tests, Scala
packages need to be installed into the local `~/.ivy` repo.

The targets do not yet understand dependencies accurately, so you may
need to re-run to make sure changes to Besom SDK or providers are
rebuilt.

As for Go changes, Pulumi CLI will respect the version of
`pulumi-language-scala` it finds in `PATH` over the default version it
ships with. When testing changes to the language provider, you
therefore might need to manipulate `PATH` to prefer the local version.

#### Publish necessary packages

Publish locally and install necessary Besom packages:
```bash
just publish-local-core
just publish-local-compiler-plugin
just install-language-plugin
```

#### Publish additional SDKs

You have to generate an SDK for a provider of your choice, to do that run:
```bash
just generate-provider-sdk ${provider_name} ${provider_version}
just publish-local-provider-sdk ${provider_name} ${provider_version}
```

e.g.:

```bash
just generate-provider-sdk kubernetes 4.2.0
just publish-local-provider-sdk kubernetes 4.2.0
```

### Working with published dependencies

Release builds of the Besom SDK are published to Maven Central 
as `org.virtuslab::besom-core:x.x.x`.

### Adding examples and testing them locally

Every example is a valid Pulumi program that can be tested by manually
doing `pulumi up` in the right folder.

```
cd exmaples/aws-scala-webserver
pulumi up
```

Here is a Just helper to run the automated testing:

```
just test-example aws-scala-webserver
```

### Testing templates locally

See `templates/README.md` on how to manually test template changes
locally.

Similarly to examples, Just helper targets are provided to
automatically test templates, for example to test
`templates/default` run:

```
just test-template default
```

## Setting up the code editor

Both IDEs support rely on BSP and is experimental.

### BSP setup
Build experimental `scala-compose` and place on `$PATH`:
```
git clone git@github.com:VirtusLab/scala-compose.git
cd scala-compose
cat << EOF | git apply
> diff --git a/project/publish.sc b/project/publish.sc
> index e00f81ca..619d4c99 100644
> --- a/project/publish.sc
> +++ b/project/publish.sc

>      }
>    else
>      T {
> -      val state = VcsVersion.vcsState()
> -      computePublishVersion(state, simple = true)
> +      // val state = VcsVersion.vcsState()
> +      // computePublishVersion(state, simple = true)
> +      "1.0.4"
>      }
>  }
>
> EOF
./mill -i show scala-compose.nativeImage
cp out/scala-compose/base-image/nativeImage.dest/scala-cli ~/bin/scala-compose
```

Use `scala-compose` in `besom` directory:
```bash
scala-compose setup-ide --conf-dir .
```

### IntelliJ setup
IntelliJ support is experimental.

1. Make sure you have the latest IntelliJ
2. Install Scala plugin and set update chanel to "Nightly Builds"
3. Use BSP ([documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/bsp-support.html))

Make sure you have `.bsp` directory before you open the project in IntelliJ.

Additionally, please set `scalafmt` as the formatter.

### VSCode setup

If you are using VSCode:
1. Install [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode#installation)
2. Open the project in Metals.

Make sure you have `.bsp` directory before you open the project in VSCode.

This might not be enough if your infrastructure is just a part (a module) of your existing Scala project.
For this to work you have to make your build tool aware of the infrastructure code,
for **sbt** create a corresponding module:
   ```scala
lazy val infra = project.in(file("infrastructure")).settings(
   libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-kubernetes" % "0.1.0", // or any other sdk you are using
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-core" % "0.1.0"
   ))
   ```
This just informs your IDE about the existence of the infrastructure module,
DO NOT remove dependencies from `project.scala`, because they are necessary in both places.
