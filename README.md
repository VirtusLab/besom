# Besom
**Besom** - a broom made of twigs tied around a stick. Brooms and besoms are used for protection, to ward off evil spirits, and cleansing of ritual spaces. Also, an experimental pulumi-scala implementation, incidentally.

## Getting started

### Publish necessary packages
Prerequisites: pulumi, just, java (JDK >= 9), scala-cli, go

Publish locally and install necessary Besom packages:
```bash
just publish-local-core
just publish-local-compiler-plugin
just install-language-plugin
```

### Publish additional sdks
You have to generate an sdk for a provider of your choice, to do that run: 
```bash
just generate-provider-sdk ${provider_name}
just publish-local-provider-sdk ${provider_name}
```

for example:

```bash
just generate-provider-sdk kubernetes
just publish-local-provider-sdk kubernetes
```

### Initialize your code with a template
You can start writing your code at this point but to help you set up Besom comes with Pulumi templates. More information about templates in `./template/README`

To initialize your project with chosen template run this in an empty folder:
```shell
pulumi new ${path_to_the_template}
```
for example:
```shell
cd ..
mkdir infra
cd infra
pulumi new ../besom/template/kubernetes
```

## Explaining the file structure
`Pulumi.yaml` is your main Pulumi file, explained [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-file/). 

`project.scala` is the file containing your dependencies.

`Main.scala` is the entry point for your infrastructure as code. Resources created in `Pulumi.run{ ... }` block will be created by Pulumi.

## Setting up the code editor

If you are using IntelliJ: 
1. install scala plugin
2. use bsp - [how to](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/bsp-support.html)  

If you are using VSCode:
1. install Metals
2. open the folder with your infrastructure and start Metals.

This might not be enough if your infrastructure is just a part (a module) of your existing scala project. For this to work you have to make your build tool aware of the infrastructure code, for **sbt** create a corresponding module: 
   ```scala
lazy val infra = project.in(file("infrastructure")).settings(
   libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-kubernetes" % "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT", // or any other sdk you are using
   "org.virtuslab" %% "besom-core" % "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"
   ))
   ```
This just informs your IDE about the existence of the infrastructure module Do not remove dependencies from `project.scala` they are necessary in both places.

## Tips
- Pass `Context` everywhere you are using Pulumi, for example when you are creating a resource.
- Resources are initialized lazily. To make them appear in your physical infrastructure make sure their evaluation is triggered directly or transitively from the main for-comprehension block of your Pulumi program.
- Use whatever scala concepts you are familiar with, infrastructure as code in Besom is still a scala program, so you have the full potential of the language to work with.
- Pay attention to the types. You will be instantiating case classes to pass parameters, note their package of origin.
